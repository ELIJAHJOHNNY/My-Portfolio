          The main objective of this project is to create a platform to give
          unwanted but useful personal items at a free or giveaway price to
          people who might need them. In order to use features offered by the
          platform, one have to create an account, get verified on their e-mail
          and sign in. Such user can now upload an item to be given out with
          specified details given including images, the condition of the item
          and their contact details. A user having an account on the platform
          can also browse all available items on the platform and contact the
          seller on any item of interest. The project was a housemanship program

          Development made us of the AGILE manifesto which allowed working on
          requirements by breaking them up into bite-sized chunks. Sprint goals
          were assigned weekly to each developer in sprint planning sessions
          held at the start of each sprint and properly managed using ClickUp (a
          project management tool) to track work progress. Each developer writes
          a documentation on every single task implemented. A demo session holds
          on the last day of each sprint to present the sprint goal in the
          staging environment.
