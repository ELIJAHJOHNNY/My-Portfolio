              Hello! My name is Elijah, a creative individual, quietly
              confident, naturally curious, perpetually working on improving my
              chops one design problem at a time, judiscious user of the AGILE
              manifesto, a lover of art and music and I always look to meet new
              and exciting people to work with or for.
              <br />
              My journey as a software engineer started in 2016 when I picked an
              interest in Python Programming and started self-learning. Though,
              I couldnâ€™t delve so deep into it being an undergraduate of Civil
              Engineering at that time. However, the interest never faded as I
              started learning HTML and CSS immediately after I graduated in
              2018 while working full-time as a Civil Engineer. My interest
              waxed stronger as I craved to build projects from scratch bringing
              ideas to life in a browser and I became a Frontend Web Development
              enthusiast hence my decision to enroll in a Software Engineering
              Bootcamp in 2022. I took a test in which passing was a criterion
              to get enrolled, and I passed and commenced training. Two major
              projects were built towards the end of the training program and I
              was made the Frontend Engineers team group lead for both.
